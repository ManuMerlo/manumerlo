### printf("Hello World!") 👋🌎
I am a 23-year-old computer engineering passionate.👩‍💻 Not only do I thrive on tech challenges, but I also face real-life ones head-on, especially when they involve a rigorous session at the gym! 💪
Professionally, I am on a constant quest to learn from the best in the tech space. 
I firmly believe that collaboration is the secret sauce to innovation and growth.
When I am not deep diving into the binary realm, I celebrate life's moments, forge relationships, and make a laugh or two. 🎉
Technically speaking, my interests range from cybersecurity to mobile development and data management. I look forward to opportunities to broaden my expertise in these domains and stay updated on the latest trends and technologies.
I am all charged up and ready to embark on my next academic and personal adventure @ KU Leuven. Excited to collaborate, innovate, and share this journey with other enthusiasts! 🚀🥳
